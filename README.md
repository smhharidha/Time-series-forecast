# ⏳ Time Series Forecasting Project

This project focuses on **time series forecasting** using Python. It explores different forecasting techniques and provides hands-on implementations with real datasets.

---

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing for time series
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Implementation of forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
- Evaluation metrics to compare model performance
- Easy-to-run Jupyter notebooks and scripts

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Libraries:**  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Statsmodels  
  - Prophet (optional)  
  - TensorFlow / Keras (if deep learning models are included)
  - streamlit

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smhharidha/Time-series-forecast.git
   cd Time-series-forecast
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # for Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # for Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
   pip install prophet         # optional
   pip install tensorflow keras  # if using deep learning models
   ```

---

## ▶️ Usage

- Open the Jupyter notebooks:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
  and explore the implementations.

- Or run Python scripts directly:
  ```bash
  python arima_model.py
  python prophet_model.py
  python lstm_model.py
  ```

---

## 📊 Example Workflow
1. Load dataset (CSV/Excel/Time-series data)
2. Perform preprocessing (missing values, resampling, normalization)
3. Visualize patterns & trends
4. Train forecasting models (ARIMA / Prophet / LSTM)
5. Evaluate with metrics like RMSE, MAPE
6. Compare models & select the best one
